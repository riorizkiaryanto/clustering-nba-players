# Clustering NBA Players

This repo has codes as well as the dataset to run the analysis regarding the clustering using National Basketball Association (NBA) data from years 2017-2018. 
The dataset itself was obtained from Kaggle and available for public [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcamli/nba17-18?select=nba.csv)

The idea of this clustering analysis came from the Bleacher report article [here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720250-brad-stevens-says-celtics-have-3-not-5-positions-now). In the article, Brad Steven as the Celtic's head coach in year 2017 stated that Celtics have 3 not 5 positons, back then. I am curios if his statement can be proven using data science approach. 

I wrote a Medium article explained more detail about how I implement the clustering model. You can read the full article [here](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/clustering-nba-player-using-k-means-7b568830edfd)
